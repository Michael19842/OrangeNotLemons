          <h2>📋 What This Game Is</h2>
          <p>
            "Orange Not Lemons" is a <strong>work of pure, unfiltered satire</strong>. It's like The Onion, 
            but in fruit form. We're making fun of <em>everything</em> - politics, power, ego, 
            social media, you name it. If you're looking for serious political commentary, 
            we recommend a news site. If you're looking for laughs at the expense of fictional fruits, 
            you're in the right place! 🎭
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> This is comedy. Not reality. We promise.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>🍋 The "Lemon Files" Clause</h2>
          <p>
            Any resemblance to actual persons, living or deceased, or actual events is 
            <strong>purely coincidental</strong>. And if you think "The Orange" looks like someone 
            you know, that's just your imagination playing tricks on you. Our orange is a completely 
            <em>fictional character</em> who happens to be orange, narcissistic, and bad at managing money. 
            If that reminds you of anyone, that's on you, buddy. 🤷
          </p>
          <p>
            We're satirizing <em>concepts</em> and <em>archetypes</em>, not specific individuals. 
            Think of it as a very elaborate fruit salad metaphor for human behavior.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>⚖️ Is This Legal?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Yes! Absolutely! 100%!</strong> Satire is protected speech in most democratic 
            countries. It's been around since ancient times - the Greeks did it, the Romans did it, 
            Shakespeare did it, and now we're doing it with emojis and slot machines. 🎰
          </p>
          <p>
            This game contains no actual defamation, libel, or slander because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>🍊 All characters are <strong>fictional fruits</strong> (last we checked, oranges can't sue)</li>
            <li>🎭 It's <strong>clearly parody</strong> (anyone with two brain cells can see that)</li>
            <li>📜 It's <strong>protected satire</strong> (thank you, First Amendment and friends)</li>
            <li>🎮 It's a <strong>game</strong>, not news reporting (we're not claiming this stuff actually happened)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>💻 Open Source & Free</h2>
          <p>
            This game is <strong>100% open source</strong> and <strong>completely free</strong>. 
            We're not making money off this. We're not affiliated with any political party, 
            organization, or fruit lobby (Big Citrus is not paying us, we swear). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The source code is publicly available because we believe in transparency. 
            Plus, if anyone wants to make their own satirical fruit simulator, 
            we're all for it. The world needs more laughing and less... well, everything else. 😅
          </p>
          <p class="code-link">
            <strong>GitHub:</strong> This game is open source! Check out the code, contribute, 
            or make your own version. Fork it, clone it, laugh at our spaghetti code. 🍝

          <h2>🎯 What We're Actually Satirizing</h2>
          <p>We're poking fun at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>📱 Social media addiction and echo chambers</li>
            <li>💰 Corruption and financial mismanagement</li>
            <li>🤥 Political spin and propaganda</li>
            <li>🎪 Cult of personality and narcissism</li>
            <li>📰 Fake news and media manipulation</li>
            <li>🎭 The absurdity of modern politics in general</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Notice how we didn't mention any specific names? That's because we're satirizing 
            <em>behaviors and systems</em>, not individuals. The fact that you might recognize 
            these patterns says more about our current timeline than about our game. 🌍

          <h2>🚨 Don't Be That Person</h2>
          <p>
            If you're thinking about getting offended and suing us, please consider:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>We have no money (seriously, this is a free hobby project) 💸</li>
            <li>Your lawyer will laugh you out of their office 👨‍⚖️</li>
            <li>You'll become a meme (and not the good kind) 🤡</li>
            <li>Satire has been legally protected for centuries 📚</li>
            <li>Life is too short to be mad at fictional fruit 🍊</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="highlight">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If this game bothers you, maybe ask yourself why. 
            Self-reflection is free and way more productive than frivolous lawsuits! 🧘

          <h2>🎮 Play Responsibly</h2>
          <p>
            This game is intended for mature audiences who understand satire. 
            If you can't tell the difference between a satirical mobile game and reality, 
            we recommend touching grass, calling a friend, or maybe adopting a pet. 
            Puppies are great for perspective. 🐕

          <p>
            Got feedback? Love the game? Hate the game? Think we're heroes? Think we're idiots? 
            That's cool! We're open to constructive feedback. Just remember we're volunteers 
            doing this for fun, not a giant corporation with HR departments.

          <p>
            If you have genuine concerns about content, we're happy to discuss it like adults. 
            But if you're planning legal action against fictional fruit, maybe reconsider your life choices first. 💭

            This is satire. It's meant to be funny. It's not real. The oranges aren't real. 
            The scandals aren't real. The Lemon Files don't exist. It's all made up for entertainment.
          </p>

            If you enjoy it, great! If you don't, that's fine too! Just don't take it seriously 
            because we certainly didn't. We made a game where you play as a corrupt orange. 
            <strong>A CORRUPT ORANGE.</strong> Come on. 🍊
